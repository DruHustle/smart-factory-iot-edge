# ESP32 WROVER Firmware

The WROVER publishes physical DHT11 temperature, relative humidity, and button state to the Pi's local Mosquitto broker over MQTT/TLS. GPIO18 remains an allowlisted digital control output; GPIO19 is dedicated to the button-state LED. It does not connect to CloudAMQP, the application database, Redis, or the internet; the Pi validates and forwards telemetry and relays short-lived output requests. For provider-side TLS guidance see [CloudAMQP MQTT setup](https://www.cloudamqp.com/docs/mqtt.html).

## Configure, build, and upload

Install PlatformIO Core or its VS Code extension and the Espressif32 platform. Connect the board over USB. From this directory:

```bash
cp include/config.example.h include/smart_factory_config.h
```

Edit the ignored `include/smart_factory_config.h` with the OT Wi-Fi SSID/password, the Pi gateway mDNS name (`smart-factory-gateway.local`) and TLS listener port (`8883`), a unique Mosquitto user/password, the CA that signed the Pi broker certificate, and the gateway-provided NTP server. The firmware resolves `.local` names through mDNS for both NTP and MQTT; TLS still checks the original `MQTT_HOST` against a DNS Subject Alternative Name on the Pi broker certificate. The ESP32 must be on a LAN that forwards mDNS multicast and allows local client-to-client traffic. Keep WROVER credentials separate from the Pi's CloudAMQP credentials. GPIO18 defaults LOW as the startup and timeout-safe control level. Confirm the connected driver treats LOW as its safe state before enabling remote control; otherwise set `CONTROL_GPIO_SAFE_LEVEL` to the verified safe level in the ignored config.

```bash
pio run
pio device list
pio run -t upload --upload-port /dev/ttyUSB0   # use the port reported by PlatformIO
pio device monitor --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --baud 115200
```

On macOS the upload port is commonly `/dev/cu.usbserial-*`; on Linux it is commonly `/dev/ttyUSB0` or `/dev/ttyACM0`. Close other serial monitors before uploading. If the shell cannot find `pio`, open the PlatformIO Core CLI terminal in VS Code or use PlatformIO's IDE build/upload buttons. Verify the firmware build succeeded before connecting it to any machinery.

`include/smart_factory_config.h` is ignored by Git. Never commit it or print production secrets to shared build logs.

## DHT11 sensor wiring

The firmware reads a DHT11 on GPIO32 by default (`DHT11_DATA_PIN` in `include/smart_factory_config.h`). GPIO32 is exposed on the ESP-WROVER-KIT header and is separate from the GPIO18 control output and GPIO19 indicator. Check the exact WROVER-KIT revision and board header labels before wiring.

- Three-pin DHT11 module: connect `VCC` to `3V3`, `GND` to `GND`, and `DATA` to GPIO32. Confirm whether the module already includes a pull-up resistor.
- Bare four-pin DHT11: identify the pins from its own datasheet/marking, then add a 4.7–10 kΩ pull-up between `DATA` and `3V3` unless the sensor board already includes one. Do not infer pin order from the front view alone.
- Keep the data signal at 3.3 V logic. Do not apply 5 V to the ESP32 data pin.

Temperature is reported in °C and humidity in %RH every five seconds. If a read fails, the payload includes `sensorStatus: "read_error"` and omits the measurement values; it does not report synthetic values. A DHT11 is suitable for a basic bench demonstration, not calibrated process measurement, asset protection, or a safety function. The WROVER does not claim vibration, power, pressure, or RPM readings without their corresponding sensors.

## Bench LED and push-button wiring

This profile reserves GPIO19 for LED 2 and GPIO21 for a momentary user button. GPIO18 remains available for the separately controlled output. Disconnect the optional LCD, camera, and microSD interfaces because these pins are shared on ESP-WROVER-KIT V4.1.

- LED 2: GPIO19 → 330 Ω series resistor → LED anode (long leg); LED cathode (short leg/flat side) → GND. It stays on while the button is held and turns off on release.
- Button: GPIO21 → one button terminal; opposite terminal → GND. The firmware uses `INPUT_PULLUP`, so no external pull-up is required. A press is active LOW and is debounced in software.

Telemetry publishes immediately when the debounced button changes and includes numeric `assetSignals.buttonPressed` (`1` while held, otherwise `0`) and `assetSignals.buttonPressCount`. The counter is stored in ESP32 nonvolatile storage, survives restart and power loss, and resets only if the device's NVS/flash is erased. The dashboard displays the current Pressed/Released state and lifetime count.

## Network and broker security

Place the WROVER and Pi broker listener on a dedicated OT Wi-Fi/VLAN. Firewall the WROVER so its only application network destination is the Pi's MQTT/TLS listener and local time service. The Pi should be the sole device-network route to the cloud. Avoid a default route or internet egress from the WROVER where the network design permits.

The example uses MQTT/TLS on port 8883 with `WiFiClientSecure`, CA validation, and hostname verification. Firmware waits for UTC time from the Pi before TLS checks and does not fall back to plaintext. Use a unique Mosquitto account per WROVER and ACLs that permit publishing only its telemetry, heartbeat, and control acknowledgement; it may subscribe only to its own command topic. GPIO requests reach the WROVER through the Pi and must be non-retained, expire within 30 seconds, and pulse an allowlisted pin for at most 2 seconds. On MQTT disconnect the outputs return to their configured safe level. Port 1883 must be blocked from the OT Wi-Fi and bound to Pi loopback for the gateway process only.

## Topics and payload

- Publish telemetry: `factory/{site}/{line}/{deviceId}/telemetry`
- Publish heartbeat: `factory/{site}/{line}/{deviceId}/heartbeat`
- Subscribe control requests: `factory/{site}/{line}/{deviceId}/commands`
- Publish control acknowledgements: `factory/{site}/{line}/{deviceId}/control-ack`

The accepted control payload is a JSON object with `schemaVersion: 1`, `action: "set_gpio"`, a unique `commandId`, `pin: 18`, `value` (`0` or `1`), `holdMs` (1–2000), and UTC Unix-millisecond `expiresAt`. GPIO19 is reserved for LED 2 and is rejected as a remote-control target. The firmware rejects unknown pins, malformed fields, expired requests, replayed command IDs, and requests before time sync. QoS 1 delivery can duplicate messages; command IDs prevent repeated pulses within the recent-ID cache. An `applied` acknowledgement confirms the GPIO level changed; it does not confirm the external machine moved or reached a safe state.

GPIO18 and GPIO19 are shared with optional camera/LCD interfaces on the ESP-WROVER-KIT. Disconnect those peripherals and verify the exact board revision and header before wiring. GPIO18 is 3.3 V logic only: connect it to a compatible isolated driver input with an external bias that holds the machine input in its safe state during boot or loss of power. GPIO19 may drive only the documented low-current LED through its resistor. Never connect a motor, coil, mains, or industrial voltage directly to an ESP32 GPIO. Do not use these outputs for emergency stop, guarding, interlocks, or other protective functions; use independent safety-rated hardware.

The DHT11 is a basic, uncalibrated bench sensor and must not be used as a process instrument. The firmware uses ArduinoMqttClient to publish telemetry and heartbeat at QoS 1 and waits for the broker acknowledgement. The Pi subscriber uses a stable MQTT client ID, a persistent session, and a Mosquitto broker with persistence enabled so QoS 1 messages can queue during brief gateway process restarts. This is at-least-once delivery, so downstream consumers should tolerate duplicates; a power-loss-proof sensor-side spool is not implemented. The current dashboard exposes ADA031 V4 jogs from the asset AAS page when an ADA031 is configured. WROVER GPIO requests are validated and relayed in the Pi/firmware code, but a dashboard control panel for those outputs is not available in this release. Do not present GPIO pulses as speed control or emergency stop.
